# Exploring-virus-genomes

An explolatory project that compares the genomes of Covid-19, SARS, Ebola and MERS. Here, we use object-oreiented progaming to build a genome class that can extract the nucleotide base compostion, guanine-cytosine content and we model transcription and translation for protien analysis.
